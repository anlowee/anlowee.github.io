Hi, this is Xiao(Âï∏xi√†o) Chong(ÂÜ≤ch≈çng) Wei(È≠èw√®i)!

I am a MASc (Master of Applied Science, which is research-based and thesis-required) alumni of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is [Ding Yuan](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~yuan/Home.html). I received my B.Eng. (June 2022) with Honours from Hongyi Hornor Colledge (Computer Science and Technology) at Wuhan University (with GPA 3.94/4.0, the top 3 of the school). My research interests include performance and failure diagnosis and optimization in large-scale software systems.

When I have time, I usually play the guitar, play video games, cook, or practice competitive algorithm contests.

## *30/07/2025* Check out our latest project: Log Archival Bench (LAB)! ü•≥

We‚Äôre excited to introduce **Log Archival Bench (LAB)** ‚Äî a benchmark designed to evaluate log archival and analytics performance across *ClickHouse*, *CLP*, *Elasticsearch*, *Presto*, and *SparkSQL*.

I was one of the primary contributors to the initial prototype of this project during its early closed-source phase. It‚Äôs been an incredibly rewarding experience working with state-of-the-art data engines and gaining a clearer sense of where we stand.

Huge thanks to [Abby][abby] and [John][john] for refining the UI and benchmark code, ultimately helping us open-source the project.

Read the full story üìñ in our [blog post][lab_blog]!

# Selected Experiences

## 10/2024-Present SWE Permanent Full Time @ YScope & SWE Contract Full Time @ Uber (Presto team)

As I mentioned, my supervisor is a great entrepreneur as well. So I joined his startup as I finished my thesis defense. It is a great honor to work with so many amazing people (because most of my colleagues are from our research group). I am responsible for various things but mainly focus on Presto-CLP (see more about CLP [here](https://blog.yscope.com/clp-efficient-and-scalable-search-on-compressed-text-logs-d8817bc1dea7)) Velox-CLP connector.

I am also a full time contractor working for Uber Presto team. On top of daily maintaining of Uber internal Presto & Velox, I am also an active OSS contributor of Presto and Velox repository, helping to implement features and fix bugs.

## 09/2022-09/2024 Research Fellow and Teaching Assistant @ University of Toronto (UTSG Campus)

My academia supervisor is Prof. Ding Yuan, who is one of the best researchers in the operating system community and also a great entrepreneur. My research project and thesis are related to performance diagnosing for large-scale system software (since it has not been published yet, I can't tell more details :p), which gains me a lot of database system, programming language and compiler experiences.

During my master, I was teaching various undergrad courses, including ECE244 (Programming Fundamentals), ECE344 (Operating System) and ECE454 (Computer Architecture) etc., which helped me to solid what I had learned during my own undergrad :p

## 01/2021-05/2022 Android SWE Internship @ ByteDance

Responsible for Android client development of **Tik Tok** in China. I have got involved in processing 13 business features and 2 technical features with 0 online accidents, and produced more than 20 technical documents, which have been read by more than thousands of internal employees. I also developed an Android Studio plugin to automate checking data serialization/deserialization which was downloaded by more than 5,000 users across the company.
